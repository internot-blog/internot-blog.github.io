# Jerma985 Reveals Shocking New Theory: Moon Landing Was Just a Secret Mission to Colonize Mars

In a stunning reveal, the world-renowned mathematician and YouTuber, Jerma985 (Jeremy Elbertson), has finally released his long-awaited manuscript on what he claims was the true purpose of the famous moon landing mission.

Entitled "The Unseen Planets: A Journey Through the Cosmos", this 800-page tome posits that the Apollo astronauts' historic journey to the lunar surface in 1969 was not, as we had all been led to believe, a mere exercise in national pride or scientific exploration. Instead, it was, according to Elbertson's startling hypothesis, an elaborate ruse - a smoke and mirrors operation designed to distract humanity from their true objective: colonizing the red planet.

## The Great Mars Ruse

Elbertson argues that, contrary to popular belief, the United States' space program was never about 'putting a man on the moon'. It was, in reality, all about planting a flag - not on the dusty surface of Earth's satellite, but deep within the alien soil of its distant sibling, Mars.

He suggests that the entire Apollo project was nothing more than a cleverly crafted distraction to keep us here on Earth preoccupied and disinterested while they secretly began terraforming our closest planetary neighbour. The moon landings were merely the first steps in a much bigger plan - one that could finally bring humanity to its promised destiny among the stars.

## The True Purpose of Neil Armstrong's Famous Quip

More shocking is Elbertson's contention that even Neil Armstrong's immortal words upon setting foot on the lunar surface, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind", contained a hidden meaning. According to him, it was not just a poetic tribute to human achievement but a coded message - an encrypted instruction to those back home in Houston who were privy to the real purpose of the mission.

"The 'one small step' was indeed a literal stepping-stone into their Mars-centric vision," Elbertson wrote, his words dripping with conviction. "But the 'one giant leap for mankind', ah! Now that's where the true meaning lies."

## The Incredible Invisibility of The Martian Colony

What makes Jerma985's theory even more compelling is his assertion that, despite decades of diligent searching and countless conspiracy theories from space enthusiasts around the world, no trace of this secret Mars colony has ever been found. Not a single photograph, not one news report, not a single footprint.

"The invisibility of it all," Elbertson wrote with an air of mystery, "is surely their greatest triumph."

## The World Reacts

Reaction to the book's publication has been swift and divided. NASA, contacted for comment, simply said they had no comment. Elon Musk, however, reportedly burst into laughter before asking his PR team to schedule a meeting with Elbertson.

The scientific community is also at odds over the veracity of Elbertson's claims. Some have praised it as a work of genius; others dismissed it outright as little more than crackpottery.

## The Call To Action

But whatever one makes of Jerma985's startling assertions, there can be no doubt that this book has sparked a much-needed global debate on the nature of space exploration and human ambition. And perhaps in time, it may even serve to inspire us all towards looking up again - past the moon, beyond Mars, into an infinite cosmos that now seems just a little less daunting than we thought.

For now though, one thing is certain: this book will change everything. Or at least make you think about whether it might.
