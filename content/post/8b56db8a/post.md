## Trump Unveils Plan for Retro-Futuristic Spaceship-Style Public Transport

In a shocking turn of events, President Donald Trump has announced his plans to redesign all public transport systems to resemble retro-futuristic spaceships. This bold move aims to revamp the nation's transit infrastructure and make it more "glorious" according to Mr. Trump himself.

The new initiative was revealed during a recent press conference where the president proudly showcased an artist's rendering of what a modern subway car might look like if redesigned with the aesthetics of a 1950s sci-fi movie set. The proposed design features curved lines, porthole-like windows, and gleaming silver panels that would undoubtedly catch any commuter's eye.

"I'm tired of these boring old buses," Trump declared to a room full of reporters. "Our public transport deserves something special! Something out of this world - quite literally. I mean, who doesn't want their daily commute to feel like they're stepping back into time and exploring the final frontier?"

The proposed redesign includes plans for gleaming chrome tailfins, futuristic digital displays showing real-time arrival times, and even a "space-like" seating arrangement with plush velour seats that are sure to make any passenger feel like royalty.

Trump also revealed that he would be working closely with NASA engineers to incorporate cutting-edge propulsion technology into the new public transport system. This means that commuters could soon experience zero-gravity effects on their daily trips as they zoom around town at lightning-fast speeds.

However, not everyone was thrilled by the announcement. Critics have argued that such an elaborate redesign is unnecessary and potentially costly, suggesting that there may be more pressing issues to address in our nation's transit infrastructure.

"This is just another example of Trump's ego getting in the way," said one concerned citizen. "I mean, who are we trying to impress here? The aliens?"

Despite criticism from some quarters, Mr. Trump remains undeterred in his quest for a more futuristic-feeling public transport system. As he put it: "You're either with me or you're left behind on the old planet Earth!"
