## The Beetroot Times Began Training Parrots for Cosmic Communications

The Beetroot Times Began, the world-renowned tabloid newspaper, recently took an unexpected turn into interstellar journalism. With headlines like "Alien Love Child Found!" and "UFO's: We've Been Landed!", it was no surprise that they would find new methods to stay ahead of the game.

## The Unlikely Key to Extra-Terrestrial Communication

The Beetroot Times Began has been secretly training a team of parrots to communicate with what they believe are extraterrestrial entities. They claim their source of these "aliens" is through a series of unexplained events involving strange lights in the sky and an occasional sighting of unusual phenomena.

## The Parrot Squad

The Beetroot Times Began has assigned their top investigative journalist, Mr. Fowl, to head up this unique project. His parrot squad consists of three parrots: Quackers, Chuckles, and Bluey. They are trained in the art of bird speak and have been taught to decipher signals that only aliens can understand.

## The Training Process

The training process is extensive and involves a series of tests and trials. Each parrot is equipped with a special headset, which allows them to receive and transmit messages through advanced technology. These birds are then placed in environments where they can observe the night sky and detect any unusual occurrences.

## The Unveiling of Their Cosmic Correspondents

The Beetroot Times Began is confident that their parrot squad will soon be able to communicate with these extraterrestrial beings. They believe that by doing so, they will be the first newspaper to break this monumental story, leaving their competitors in the dust.

In a recent press release, Mr. Fowl stated, "We are one step closer to revolutionizing journalism as we know it. With our advanced technology and team of highly trained parrots, we're sure that soon enough, the skies will be filled with news from beyond."

## The Future of Journalism

As the world waits in anticipation for this historic moment, one can't help but wonder what other unconventional methods newspapers may employ to stay relevant in today's fast-paced digital age. Will it be a team of trained dolphins reporting on global events? Or perhaps a flock of hummingbirds delivering breaking news from around the globe?

Whatever the case may be, one thing is certain: The Beetroot Times Began continues to push the boundaries of journalism with their cutting-edge parrot squad and extraterrestrial communication attempts. They are truly taking it beyond "just the facts" and into the realm of intergalactic reporting.

So next time you hear a strange chirping sound coming from your backyard, don't be alarmed - it might just be our intrepid feathered journalists breaking news from another world!
