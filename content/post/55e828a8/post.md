## Matthew McConaughey Just spent 3 months in the Himalayas with Jack Dorsey writing an album about esoteric programming languages.

### "Matthews and Dorseys"

Matthew McConaughey is no stranger to unique collaborations. From his critically acclaimed performance as a serial killer in Texas Killing Fields, to his more recent role as a high school teacher in Just Like Magic, he has always been known for his ability to dive deep into complex characters. But this time, Matthew took it up a notch by joining forces with none other than Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter and Square.

The two decided to trade their city lights for the serene Himalayas and embark on an adventure unlike any other. While most people might find themselves lost in the mountains, these two found solace in writing songs about esoteric programming languages.

"Programming language? Who knew?" Matthew laughed when asked how he got into this unique venture. "Jack was just sitting there with his Square account open and a coffee in hand. I looked at him and said, 'Hey buddy, we should make music about this stuff.' And the rest is history."

The album, tentatively titled "Syntax Serenades," promises to be a delightful mix of catchy melodies and obscure programming language references. Songs like "The FOR Loop" and "GOTO Gotta Go" are sure to become fan favorites.

But what's the point? you might ask. Why write songs about programming languages?

Matthew had an answer for that too. "It's not just about writing songs," he explained. "It's about spreading joy, man! It's about bringing people together through the universal language of music and code."

As we speak to Matthew McConaughey on the phone from his remote Himalayan cabin, we can hear the excitement in his voice. "We've got some killer tracks coming up," he said. "And I'm not just saying that because they're written in K&R C style."

"Syntax Serenades" is set to drop this summer, so be sure to keep an eye out for it! And who knows? Maybe one day, you'll find yourself humming the tune of "The while Loop" at a coffee shop near you.
